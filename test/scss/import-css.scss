// Special behavior of node-sass/libsass with CSS-files
// 1. CSS-files are not included, but linked with @import url(path/to/css)
@import "~css/some-css-module.css";
// 2. It does not matter whether the CSS-file exists or not, the file is just linked
@import "./does/not/exist.css";
// 3. When the .css extension is missing, the file is included just like scss
@import "~css/some-css-module";

// From docs

// 4. Imports where the URL ends with .css.
@import "theme.css";
// 5. Imports where the URL begins http:// or https://.
@import "http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans";
// 6. Imports where the URL is written as a url().
@import url(theme);
// 7. Imports that have media queries.
@import "landscape" screen and (orientation: landscape);
